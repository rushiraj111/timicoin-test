Timicoin integration/staging repository
=====================================

Timicoin is an open source crypto-currency that is used as the fuel for TimiHR - The decentralised Healthcare Information Exchange. It is used to make a purchase on the exchange and to reward those who share their health data to consumers.

Timicoin also focuses on the efficiency and appropriate reward mechanism for the miners who work to validate the transactions. It is a hybrid PoW/PoS kind of blockchain. It utilizes a custom Proof of Stake protocol for securing its network and uses an innovative variable seesaw reward mechanism that dynamically balances 90% of its block reward size between masternodes and staking nodes and 10% dedicated for budget proposals. The goal of Timicoin is to achieve a decentralized sustainable crypto currency with near instant full-time private transactions, fair governance and community intelligence.

- Fast transactions featuring guaranteed zero confirmation transactions, we call it _SwiftX_.
- Decentralized blockchain voting utilizing Masternode technology to form a DAO. The blockchain will distribute monthly treasury funds based on successful proposals submitted by the community and voted on by the DAO.
